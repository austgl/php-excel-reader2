This PHP library expands on the great work done in the PHP Excel Reader project on SourceForge and later on Google Code

It reads the binary format of XLS files directly and can return values and formats from any cell.

# 12/2013 - Added version 2.23 due to requests, fixes error with Unicode file names. #

# This Library is NO LONGER developed. #

I will only add fixes that are submited to me, I will not work on any additions/fixes.
